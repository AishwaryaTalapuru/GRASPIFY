Chapter 1
Harmonic Oscillation
Oscillators are the basic building blocks of waves. We begin by discussing the harmonic
oscillator. We will identify the general principles that make the harmonic oscillator so special and important. To make use of these principles, we must introduce the mathematical
device of complex numbers. But the advantage of introducing this mathematics is that we
can understand the solution to the harmonic oscillator problem in a new way. We show that
the properties of linearity and time translation invariance lead to solutions that are complex
exponential functions of time.

In this chapter, we discuss harmonic oscillation in systems with only one degree of freedom.
1. We begin with a review of the simple harmonic oscillator, noting that the equation of
motion of a free oscillator is linear and invariant under time translation;
2. We discuss linearity in more detail, arguing that it is the generic situation for small
oscillations about a point of stable equilibrium;
3. We discuss time translation invariance of the harmonic oscillator, and the connection
between harmonic oscillation and uniform circular motion;
4. We introduce complex numbers, and discuss their arithmetic;
5. Using complex numbers, we find solutions to the equation of motion for the harmonic
oscillator that behave as simply as possible under time translations. We call these
solutions “irreducible.” We show that they are actually complex exponentials.
6. We discuss an LC circuit and draw an analogy between it and a system of a mass and
springs.

7. We discuss units.
8. We give one simple example of a nonlinear oscillator.
1.1 The Harmonic Oscillator
When you studied mechanics, you probably learned about the harmonic oscillator. We will
begin our study of wave phenomena by reviewing this simple but important physical system.
Consider a block with mass, m, free to slide on a frictionless air-track, but attached to a light1
Hooke’s law spring with its other end attached to a fixed wall. A cartoon representation of
this physical system is shown in figure 1.1.
Figure 1.1: A mass on a spring.
This system has only one relevant degree of freedom. In general, the number of degrees of freedom of a system is the number of coordinates that must be specified in order
to determine the configuration completely. In this case, because the spring is light, we can
assume that it is uniformly stretched from the fixed wall to the block. Then the only important
coordinate is the position of the block.
In this situation, gravity plays no role in the motion of the block. The gravitational force
is canceled by a vertical force from the air track. The only relevant force that acts on the
block comes from the stretching or compression of the spring. When the spring is relaxed,
there is no force on the block and the system is in equilibrium. Hooke’s law tells us that
the force from the spring is given by a negative constant, −K, times the displacement of the
block from its equilibrium position. Thus if the position of the block at some time is x and
its equilibrium position is x , then the force on the block at that moment is
F = −K(x − x ) . (1.1)
1“Light” here means that the mass of the spring is small enough to be ignored in the analysis of the motion
of the block. We will explain more precisely what this means in chapter 7 when we discuss waves in a massive
spring.
1.1. THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR 3
The constant, K, is called the “spring constant.” It has units of force per unit distance, or
MT −2 in terms of M (the unit of mass), L (the unit of length) and T (the unit of time). We
can always choose to measure the position, x, of the block with our origin at the equilibrium
position. If we do this, then x = 0 in (1.1) and the force on the block takes the simpler form
F = −Kx. (1.2)
Harmonic oscillation results from the interplay between the Hooke’s law force and Newton’s law, F = ma. Let x(t) be the displacement of the block as a function of time, t. Then
Newton’s law implies
m x(t) = −Kx(t) . (1.3)
dt2
An equation of this form, involving not only the function x(t), but also its derivatives is called
a “differential equation.” The differential equation, (1.3), is the “equation of motion” for the
system of figure 1.1. Because the system has only one degree of freedom, there is only one
equation of motion. In general, there must be one equation of motion for each independent
coordinate required to specify the configuration of the system.
The most general solution to the differential equation of motion, (1.3), is a sum of a
constant times cos ωt plus a constant times sin ωt,
x(t) = a cos ωt + b sin ωt , (1.4)
where s
ω ≡ (1.5)
is a constant with units of T −1 called the “angular frequency.” The angular frequency will be
a very important quantity in our study of wave phenomena. We will almost always denote it
by the lower case Greek letter, ω (omega).
Because the equation involves a second time derivative but no higher derivatives, the
most general solution involves two constants. This is just what we expect from the physics,
because we can get a different solution for each value of the position and velocity of the
block at the starting time. Generally, we will think about determining the solution in terms
of the position and velocity of the block when we first get the motion started, at a time that
we conventionally take to be t = 0. For this reason, the process of determining the solution
in terms of the position and velocity at a given time is called the “initial value problem.”
The values of position and velocity at t = 0 are called initial conditions. For example, we
can write the most general solution, (1.4), in terms of x(0) and x0(0), the displacement and
velocity of the block at time t = 0. Setting t = 0 in (1.4) gives a = x(0). Differentiating and
then setting t = 0 gives b = ωx0(0). Thus
x(t) = x(0) cos ωt + x0 (0) sin ωt . (1.6)
4 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
For example, suppose that the block has a mass of 1 kilogram and that the spring is 0.5
meters long2 with a spring constant K of 100 newtons per meter. To get a sense of what
this spring constant means, consider hanging the spring vertically (see problem (1.1)). The
gravitational force on the block is
mg ≈ 9.8 newtons . (1.7)
In equilibrium, the gravitational force cancels the force from the spring, thus the spring is
stretched by
≈ 0.098 meters = 9.8 centimeters . (1.8)
For this mass and spring constant, the angular frequency, ω, of the system in figure 1.1 is
s s
K 100 N/m 1
ω = = = 10 . (1.9)
M 1kg s
If, for example, the block is displaced by 0.01 m (1 cm) from its equilibrium position and
released from rest at time, t = 0, the position at any later time t is given (in meters) by
x(t) = 0.01 × cos 10t. (1.10)
The velocity (in meters per second) is
x0 (t) = −0.1 × sin 10t. (1.11)
The motion is periodic, in the sense that the system oscillates — it repeats the same motion
over and over again indefinitely. After a time
τ = ≈ 0.628 s (1.12)
the system returns exactly to where it was at t = 0, with the block instantaneously at rest
with displacement 0.01 meter. The time, τ (Greek letter tau) is called the “period” of the
oscillation. However, the solution, (1.6), is more than just periodic. It is “simple harmonic”
motion, which means that only a single frequency appears in the motion.
The angular frequency, ω, is the inverse of the time required for the phase of the wave to
change by one radian. The “frequency”, usually denoted by the Greek letter, ν (nu), is the
inverse of the time required for the phase to change by one complete cycle, or 2π radians,
and thus get back to its original state. The frequency is measured in hertz, or cycles/second.
Thus the angular frequency is larger than the frequency by a factor of 2π,
ω (in radians/second) = 2π (radians/cycle) · ν (cycles/second) . (1.13)
2The length of the spring plays no role in the equations below, but we include it to allow you to build a mental
picture of the physical system.
1.2. SMALL OSCILLATIONS AND LINEARITY 5
The frequency, ν, is the inverse of the period, τ, of (1.12),
ν = . (1.14)
Simple harmonic motion like (1.6) occurs in a very wide variety of physical systems. The
question with which we will start our study of wave phenomena is the following: Why do
solutions of the form of (1.6) appear so ubiquitously in physics? What do harmonically
oscillating systems have in common? Of course, the mathematical answer to this question
is that all of these systems have equations of motion of essentially the same form as (1.3).
We will find a deeper and more physical answer that we will then be able to generalize to
more complicated systems. The key features that all these systems have in common with the
mass on the spring are (at least approximate) linearity and time translation invariance of the
equations of motion. It is these two features that determine oscillatory behavior in systems
from springs to inductors and capacitors.
Each of these two properties is interesting on its own, but together, they are much more
powerful. They almost completely determine the form of the solutions. We will see that if
the system is linear and time translation invariant, we can always write its motion as a sum
of simple motions in which the time dependence is either harmonic oscillation or exponential
decay (or growth).
1.2 Small Oscillations and Linearity
A system with one degree of freedom is linear if its equation of motion is a linear function
of the coordinate, x, that specifies the system’s configuration. In other words, the equation of
motion must be a sum of terms each of which contains at most one power of x. The equation
of motion involves a second derivative, but no higher derivatives, so a linear equation of
motion has the general form:
d2 d
α x(t)+ β x(t)+ γx(t) = f(t) . (1.15)
dt2 dt
If all of the terms involve exactly one power of x, the equation of motion is “homogeneous.”
Equation (1.15) is not homogeneous because of the term on the right-hand side. The “inhomogeneous” term, f(t), represents an external force. The corresponding homogeneous
equation would look like this:
d2 d
α x(t)+ β x(t)+ γx(t) = 0 . (1.16)
dt2 dt
In general, α, β and γ as well as f could be functions of t. However, that would break
the time translation invariance that we will discuss in more detail below and make the system
6 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
much more complicated. We will almost always assume that α, β and γ are constants. The
equation of motion for the mass on a spring, (1.3), is of this general form, but with β and f
equal to zero. As we will see in chapter 2, we can include the effect of frictional forces by
allowing nonzero β, and the effect of external forces by allowing nonzero f.
The linearity of the equation of motion, (1.15), implies that if x (t) is a solution for
external force f (t),
d2 d
α x (t)+ β x (t)+ γx (t) = f (t) , (1.17)
dt2 1 dt 1 1 1
and x (t) is a solution for external force f (t),
d2 d
α x (t)+ β x (t)+ γx (t) = f (t) , (1.18)
dt2 2 dt 2 2 2
then the sum,
x (t) = Ax (t)+ Bx (t) , (1.19)
for constants A and B is a solution for external force Af + Bf ,
d2 d
α x (t)+ β x (t)+ γx (t) = Af (t)+ Bf (t) . (1.20)
dt2 12 dt 12 12 1 2
The sum x (t) is called a “linear combination” of the two solutions, x (t) and x (t). In
the case of “free” motion, which means motion with no external force, if x (t) and x (t) are
solutions, then the sum, Ax (t)+ Bx (t) is also a solution.
The most general solution to any of these equations involves two constants that must be
fixed by the initial conditions, for example, the initial position and velocity of the particle, as
in (1.6). It follows from (1.20) that we can always write the most general solution for any
external force, f(t), as a sum of the “general solution” to the homogeneous equation, (1.16),
and any “particular” solution to (1.15).
No system is exactly linear. “Linearity” is never exactly “true.” Nevertheless, the idea of
linearity is extremely important, because it is a useful approximation in a very large number
of systems, for a very good physical reason. In almost any system in which the properties are
smooth functions of the positions of the parts, the small displacements from equilibrium produce approximately linear restoring forces. The difference between something that is “true”
and something that is a useful approximation is the essential difference between physics and
mathematics. In the real world, the questions are much too interesting to have answers
that are exact. If you can understand the answer in a well-defined approximation, you
have learned something important.
To see the generic nature of linearity, consider a particle moving on the x-axis with potential energy, V (x). The force on the particle at the point, x, is minus the derivative of the
potential energy,
F = − V (x) . (1.21)
1.2. SMALL OSCILLATIONS AND LINEARITY 7
A force that can be derived from a potential energy in this way is called a “conservative”
force.
At a point of equilibrium, x , the force vanishes, and therefore the derivative of the
potential energy vanishes:
F = − V (x)| = −V 0(x ) = 0 . (1.22)
dx x=x0 0
We can describe the small oscillations of the system about equilibrium most simply if we
redefine the origin so that x = 0. Then the displacement from equilibrium is the coordinate
x. We can expand the force in a Taylor series:
F (x) = −V 0(x) = −V 0(0) − xV 00(0) − x2 V 000(0) + ··· (1.23)
The first term in (1.23) vanishes because this system is in equilibrium at x = 0, from (1.22).
The second term looks like Hooke’s law with
K = V 00(0) . (1.24)
The equilibrium is stable if the second derivative of the potential energy is positive, so that
x = 0 is a local minimum of the potential energy.
The important point is that for sufficiently small x, the third term in (1.23), and all
subsequent terms will be much smaller than the second. The third term is negligible if
¯xV 000(0)¯ ¿ V 00(0) . (1.25)
Typically, each extra derivative will bring with it a factor of 1/L, where L is the distance over
which the potential energy changes by a large fraction. Then (1.25) becomes
x ¿ L. (1.26)
There are only two ways that a force derived from a potential energy can fail to be approximately linear for sufficiently small oscillations about stable equilibrium:
1. If the potential is not smooth so that the first or second derivative of the potential is not
well defined at the equilibrium point, then we cannot do a Taylor expansion and the
argument of (1.23) does not work. We will give an example of this kind at the end of
this chapter.
2. Even if the derivatives exist at the equilibrium point, x = 0, it may happen that
V 00(0) = 0. In this case, to have a stable equilibrium, we must have V 000(0) = 0
as well, otherwise a small displacement in one direction or the other would grow with
time. Then the next term in the Taylor expansion dominates at small x, giving a force
proportional to x3.

Figure 1.2: The potential energy of (1.27).
Both of these exceptional cases are very rare in nature. Usually, the potential energy is a
smooth function of the displacement and there is no reason for V 00(0) to vanish. The generic
situation is that small oscillations about stable equilibrium are linear.
An example may be helpful. Almost any potential energy function with a point of stable
equilibrium will do, so long as it is smooth. For example, consider the following potential
energy

V (x) = E + . (1.27)

This is shown in figure 1.2. The minimum (at least for positive x) occurs at x = L, so we
first redefine x = X + L, so that

we can look near X = 0 and expand in a Taylor series:
µ ¶ µ ¶

F (X) = −2 +3 + ··· (1.30)
L L L L
Now, the ratio of the first nonlinear term to the linear term is
1.3. TIME TRANSLATION INVARIANCE 9
which is small if X ¿ L.
In other words, the closer you are to the equilibrium point, the closer the actual potential
energy is to the parabola that we would expect from the potential energy for a linear, Hooke’s
law force. You can see this graphically by blowing up a small region around the equilibrium
point. In figure 1.3, the dotted rectangle in figure 1.2 has been blown up into a square. Note
that it looks much more like a parabola than figure 1.3. If we repeated the procedure and
again expanded a small region about the equilibrium point, you would not be able to detect
the cubic term by eye.

Figure 1.3: The small dashed rectangle in figure 1.2 expanded.
Often, the linear approximation is even better, because the term of order x2 vanishes by
symmetry. For example, when the system is symmetrical about x = 0, so that V (x) =
V (−x), the order x3 term (and all xn for n odd) in the potential energy vanishes, and then
there is no order x2 term in the force.
For a typical spring, linearity (Hooke’s law) is an excellent approximation for small displacements. However, there are always nonlinear terms that become important if the displacements are large enough. Usually, in this book we will simply stick to small oscillations
and assume that our systems are linear. However, you should not conclude that the subject
of nonlinear systems is not interesting. In fact, it is a very active area of current research in
physics.
1.3 Time Translation Invariance
1.3.1 Uniform Circular Motion
10 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
When α, β and γ in (1.15) do not depend on the time, t, and in the absence of an external
force, that is for free motion, time enters in (1.15) only through derivatives. Then the equation
of motion has the form.
d2 d
α x(t)+ β x(t)+ γx(t) = 0 . (1.32)
dt2 dt
The equation of motion for the undamped harmonic oscillator, (1.3), has this form with α =
m, β = 0 and γ = K. Solutions to (1.32) have the property that
If x(t) is a solution, x(t + a) will be a solution also. (1.33)
Mathematically, this is true because the operations of differentiation with respect to time and
replacing t → t + a can be done in either order because of the chain rule
d d d d
x(t + a) = (t + a) x(t0) = x(t0) . (1.34)
dt dt dt0 dt0
t0=t+a t0=t+a
The physical reason for (1.33) is that we can change the initial setting on our clock and the
physics will look the same. The solution x(t + a) can be obtained from the solution x(t) by
changing the clock setting by a. The time label has been “translated” by a. We will refer to
the property, (1.33), as time translation invariance.
Most physical systems that you can think of are time translation invariant in the absence
of an external force. To get an oscillator without time translation invariance, you would have
to do something rather bizarre, such as somehow making the spring constant depend on time.
For the free motion of the harmonic oscillator, although the equation of motion is certainly time translation invariant, the manifestation of time translation invariance on the solution, (1.6) is not as simple as it could be. The two parts of the solution, one proportional to
cos ωt and the other to sin ωt, get mixed up when the clock is reset. For example,
cos [ω(t + a)] = cos ωa cos ωt − sin ωa sin ωt . (1.35)
It will be very useful to find another way of writing the solution that behaves more simply
under resetting of the clocks. To do this, we will have to work with complex numbers.
To motivate the introduction of complex numbers, we will begin by exhibiting the relation
between simple harmonic motion and uniform circular motion. Consider uniform circular
motion in the x-y plane around a circle centered at the origin, x = y = 0, with radius R and
with clockwise velocity v = Rω. The x and y coordinates of the motion are
x(t) = R cos(ωt − φ) , y(t) = −R sin(ωt − φ) , (1.36)
where φ is the counterclockwise angle in radians of the position at t = 0 from the positive x
axis. The x(t) in (1.36) is identical to the x(t) in (1.6) with
x(0) = R cos φ, x0 (0) = ωR sin φ. (1.37)
1.3. TIME TRANSLATION INVARIANCE 11
Simple harmonic motion is equivalent to one component of uniform circular motion. This
relation is illustrated in figure 1.4 and in program 1-1 on the programs disk. As the point
moves around the circle at constant velocity, Rω, the x coordinate executes simple harmonic
motion with angular velocity ω. If we wish, we can choose the two constants required to fix
the solution of (1.3) to be R and φ, instead of x(0) and x0(0). In this language, the action of
resetting of the clock is more transparent. Resetting the clock changes the value of φ without
changing anything else.

Figure 1.4: The relation between uniform circular motion and simple harmonic motion.
But we would like even more. The key idea is that linearity allows us considerable
freedom. We can add solutions of the equations of motion together and multiply them by
constants, and the result is still a solution. We would like to use this freedom to choose
solutions that behave as simply as possible under time translations.
The simplest possible behavior for a solution z(t) under time translation is
z(t + a) = h(a) z(t) . (1.38)
That is, we would like find a solution that reproduces itself up to an overall constant, h(a)
when we reset our clocks by a. Because we are always free to multiply a solution of a
homogeneous linear equation of motion by a constant, the change from z(t) to h(a) z(t)
doesn’t amount to much. We will call a solution satisfying (1.38) an “irreducible3 solution”
with respect to time translations, because its behavior under time translations (resettings of
the clock) is as simple as it can possibly be.
It turns out that for systems whose equations of motion are linear and time translation
invariant, as we will see in more detail below, we can always find irreducible solutions that
3The word “irreducible” is borrowed from the theory of group representations. In the language of group
theory, the irreducible solution is an “irreducible representation of the translation group.” It just means “as simple
as possible.”
12 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
have the property, (1.38). However, for simple harmonic motion, this requires complex numbers. You can see this by noting that changing the clock setting by π/ω just changes the sign
of the solution with angular frequency ω, because both the cos and sin terms change sign:
cos(ωt + π) = − cos ωt , sin(ωt + π) = − sin ωt . (1.39)
But then from (1.38) and (1.39), we can write
−z(t) = z(t + π/ω) = z(t + π/2ω + π/2ω)
= h(π/2ω) z(t + π/2ω) = h(π/2ω)2 z(t) .
Thus we cannot find such a solution unless h(π/2ω) has the property
[h(π/2ω)]2 = −1 . (1.41)
The square of h(π/2ω) is −1! Thus we are forced to consider complex numbers.4 When
we finish introducing complex numbers, we will come back to (1.38) and show that we can
always find solutions of this form for systems that are linear and time translation invariant.
1.4 Complex Numbers
The square root of −1, called i, is important in physics and mathematics for many reasons.
Measurable physical quantities can always be described by real numbers. You never get a
reading of i meters on your meter stick. However, we will see that when i is included along
with real numbers and the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division), then algebra, trigonometry and calculus all become simpler. While complex
numbers are not necessary to describe wave phenomena, they will allow us to discuss them
in a simpler and more insightful way.
1.4.1 Some Definitions
An imaginary number is a number of the form i times a real number.
A complex number, z, is a sum of a real number and an imaginary number: z = a + ib.
The real and “imaginary” parts, Re (z) and Im (z), of the complex number z = a +ib:
Re (z) = a, Im (z) = b. (1.42)
4The connection between complex numbers and uniform circular motion has been exploited by Richard Feynman in his beautiful little book, QED.
1.4. COMPLEX NUMBERS 13
Note that the imaginary part is actually a real number, the real coefficient of i in z = a + ib.
The complex conjugate, z ∗, of the complex number z, is obtained by changing the sign
of i:
z ∗ = a − ib . (1.43)
Note that Re (z) = (z + z ∗)/2 and Im (z) = (z − z ∗)/2i.
The complex plane: Because a complex number z is specified by two real numbers, it
can be thought of as a two-dimensional vector, with components (a, b). The real part of z,
a = Re(z), is the x component and the imaginary part of z, b = Im(z), is the y component.
The diagrams in figures 1.5 and 1.6 show two vectors in the complex plane along with the
corresponding complex numbers:
The absolute value, |z|, of z, is the length of the vector (a, b):
p √
|z| = a2 + b2 = z ∗z. (1.44)
The absolute value |z| is always a real, non-negative number.
2+ i ↔ (2, 1)
© θ = arg(2 + i) = arctan(1/2)
Figure 1.5: A vector with positive real part in the complex plane.
The argument or phase, arg(z), of a nonzero complex number z, is the angle, in radians,
of the vector (a, b) counterclockwise from the x axis:
arctan(b/a) for a ≥ 0 ,
arg(z) = (1.45)
arctan(b/a)+ π for a < 0 .
14 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
Like any angle, arg(z) can be redefined by adding a multiple of 2π radians or 360◦ (see
figure 1.5 and 1.6).
θ = arg(−1.5 − 2i) . .
= arctan(4/3) + π .
arctan(4/3) −1.5 − 2i ↔ (−1.5, −2)
Figure 1.6: A vector with negative real part in the complex plane.
1.4.2 Arithmetic
The arithmetic operations addition, subtraction and multiplication on complex numbers are
defined by just treating the i like a variable in algebra, using the distributive law and the
relation i2 = −1. Thus if z = a + ib and z0 = a0 + ib0, then
z + z 0 = (a + a0 )+ i(b + b0) ,
z − z0 = (a − a0)+ i(b − b0) , (1.46)
zz0 = (aa0 − bb0)+ i(ab0 + ba0) .
For example:
(3 + 4i)+(−2+7i) = (3 − 2) + (4 + 7)i = 1+11i, (1.47)
(3 + 4i) · (5 + 7i) = (3 · 5 − 4 · 7) + (3 · 7+4 · 5)i = −13 + 41i. (1.48)
It is worth playing with complex multiplication and getting to know the complex plane.
At this point, you should check out program 1-2.
1.4. COMPLEX NUMBERS 15
Division is more complicated. To divide a complex number z by a real number r is easy,
just divide both the real and the imaginary parts by r to get z/r = a/r + ib/r. To divide
by a complex number, z0, we can use the fact that z0∗ z0 = |z0|2 is real. If we multiply the
numerator and the denominator of z/z0 by z0∗, we can write:
z/z0 = z 0∗z/|z 0|2 = (aa0 + bb0)/(a0 2 + b02)+ i(ba0 − ab0)/(a0 2 + b02) . (1.49)
For example:
(3 + 4i)/(2 + i) = (3+4i) · (2 − i)/5 = (10+5i)/5 = 2+ i. (1.50)
With these definitions for the arithmetic operations, the absolute value behaves in a very
simple way under multiplication and division. Under multiplication, the absolute value of a
product of two complex numbers is the product of the absolute values:
|zz 0| = |z||z 0| . (1.51)
Division works the same way so long as you don’t divide by zero:
|z/z0| = |z|/|z 0| if z 0 6= 0 . (1.52)
Mathematicians call a set of objects on which addition and multiplication are defined
and for which there is an absolute value satisfying (1.51) and (1.52) a division algebra. It
is a peculiar (although irrelevant, for us) mathematical fact that the complex numbers are
one of only four division algebras, the others being the real numbers and more bizarre things
called quaternions and octonians obtained by relaxing the requirements of commutativity and
associativity (respectively) of the multiplication laws.
The wonderful thing about the complex numbers from the point of view of algebra is that
all polynomial equations have solutions. For example, the equation x2 − 2x + 5 = 0 has
no solutions in the real numbers, but has two complex solutions, x = 1 ± 2i. In general, an
equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree n with complex (or
real) coefficients has n solutions if complex numbers are allowed, but it may not have any if
x is restricted to be real.
Note that the complex conjugate of any sum, product, etc, of complex numbers can be
obtained simply by changing the sign of i wherever it appears. This implies that if the polynomial p(z) has real coefficients, the solutions of p(z) = 0 come in complex conjugate pairs.
That is, if p(z) = 0, then p(z ∗) = 0 as well.
1.4.3 Complex Exponentials
Consider a complex number z = a + ib with absolute value 1. Because |z| = 1 implies
a2 + b2 = 1, we can write a and b as the cosine and sine of an angle θ.
z = cos θ + i sin θ for |z| = 1 . (1.53)
16 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
Because
sin θ b
tan θ = = (1.54)
cos θ a
the angle θ is the argument of z:
arg(cos θ + i sin θ) = θ . (1.55)
Let us think about z as a function of θ and consider the calculus. The derivative with
respect to θ is:
(cos θ + i sin θ) = − sin θ + i cos θ = i(cos θ + i sin θ) (1.56)
A function that goes into itself up to a constant under differentiation is an exponential. In
particular, if we had a function of θ, f(θ), that satisfied ∂ f(θ) = kf(θ) for real k, we would
conclude that f(θ) = ekθ. Thus if we want the calculus to work in the same way for complex
numbers as for real numbers, we must conclude that
e iθ = cos θ + i sin θ. (1.57)
We can check this relation by noting that the Taylor series expansions of the two sides
are equal. The Taylor expansion of the exponential, cos, and sin functions are:
x2 x3 x4
e x = 1+ x + + + + ···
x2 x4
cos(x) = 1 − + ···
sin(x) = x − + ···
Thus the Taylor expansion of the left side of (1.57) is
1+ iθ +(iθ)2/2+(iθ)3/3! + ··· (1.59)
while the Taylor expansion of the right side is
(1 − θ2/2+ ···)+ i(θ − θ3/6+ ···) (1.60)
The powers of i in (1.59) work in just the right way to reproduce the pattern of minus signs
in (1.60).
Furthermore, the multiplication law works properly:
eiθ e iθ0 = (cos θ + i sin θ)(cos θ0 + i sin θ0)
= (cos θ cos θ0 − sin θ sin θ0)+ i(sin θ cos θ0 + cos θ sin θ0) (1.61)
= cos(θ + θ0)+ i sin(θ + θ0) = ei(θ+θ0).
1.4. COMPLEX NUMBERS 17
Thus (1.57) makes sense in all respects. This connection between complex exponentials
and trigonometric functions is called Euler’s Identity. It is extremely useful. For one thing,
the logic can be reversed and the trigonometric functions can be “defined” algebraically in
terms of complex exponentials:
eiθ + e−iθ
cos θ =
eiθ − e−iθ eiθ − e−iθ
sin θ = = −i .
2i 2
Using (1.62), trigonometric identities can be derived very simply. For example:
cos 3θ = Re(e3 iθ) = Re((e iθ)3) = cos3 θ − 3 cos θ sin2 θ. (1.63)
Another example that will be useful to us later is:
cos(θ + θ0) + cos(θ − θ0) = (ei (θ+θ0) + e −i(θ+θ0) + e i(θ−θ0) + e −i(θ−θ0))/2
= (eiθ + e−iθ)(eiθ0 + e−iθ0)/2 = 2cos θ cos θ0 .
Every nonzero complex number can be written as the product of a positive real number
(its absolute value) and a complex number with absolute value 1. Thus
z = x + iy = Reiθ where R = |z| , and θ = arg(z) . (1.65)
In the complex plane, (1.65) expresses the fact that a two-dimensional vector can be written
either in Cartesian coordinates, (x, y), or in polar coordinates, (R, θ). For example, 3+i =
2eiπ/6; 1+ i = 2 eiπ/4; −8i = 8e3iπ/2 = 8e−iπ/2. Figure 1.7 shows the complex number
1+ i = 2 eiπ/4 .
The relation, (1.65), gives another useful way of thinking about multiplication of complex
numbers. If
z = R e iθ1 and z = R ei θ2 , (1.66)
then
z z = R R e i(θ1+θ2) . (1.67)
In words, to multiply two complex numbers, you multiply the absolute values and add the
arguments. You should now go back and play with program 1-2 with this relation in mind.
Equation (1.57) yields a number of relations that may seem surprising until you get used
to them. For example: eiπ = −1; eiπ/2 = i; e2iπ = 1. These have an interpretation in the
complex plane where eiθ is the unit vector (cos θ, sin θ),

which is at an angle θ measured counterclockwise from the x axis. Then −1 is 180◦ or π
radians counterclockwise from the x axis, while i is along the y axis, 90◦ or π/2 radians
from the x axis. 2π radians is 360◦, and thus rotates us all the way back to the x axis. These
relations are shown in figure 1.8.
1.4.4 Notation
It is not really necessary to have a notation that distinguishes between real numbers and
complex numbers. The reason is that, as we have seen, the rules of arithmetic, algebra and
calculus apply to real and complex numbers in exactly the same way. Nevertheless, some
readers may find it helpful to be reminded when a quantity is complex. This is probably
particularly useful for the quantities like x that represent physical coordinates. Therefore, at
least for the first few chapters until the reader is thoroughly complexified, we will distinguish
between real and complex “coordinates.” If they are real, we will use letters x and y. If they
are complex, we will use z and w.
1.5 Exponential Solutions
We are now ready to translate the conditions of linearity and time translation invariance into
mathematics. What we will see is that the two properties of linearity and time translation
invariance lead automatically to irreducible solutions satisfying (1.38), and furthermore that

these irreducible solutions are just exponentials. We do not need to use any other details
about the equation of motion to get this result. Therefore our arguments will apply to much
more complicated situations, in which there is damping or more degrees of freedom or both.
So long as the system has time translation invariance and linearity, the solutions will be
sums of irreducible exponential solutions.
We have seen that the solutions of homogeneous linear differential equations with constant coefficients, of the form,
M x(t)+ K x(t) = 0 , (1.68)
dt2
have the properties of linearity and time translation invariance. The equation of simple harmonic motion is of this form. The coordinates are real, and the constants M and K are real
because they are physical things like masses and spring constants. However, we want to allow ourselves the luxury of considering complex solutions as well, so we consider the same
equation with complex variables:
M z(t)+ K z(t) = 0 . (1.69)
dt2
Note the relation between the solutions to (1.68) and (1.69). Because the coefficients
M and K are real, for every solution, z(t), of (1.69), the complex conjugate, z(t)∗, is also
a solution. The differential equation remains true when the signs of all the i’s are changed.
20 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
From these two solutions, we can construct two real solutions:
x (t) = Re (z(t)) = (z(t)+ z(t)∗) /2;
x (t) = Im (z(t)) = (z(t) − z(t)∗) /2i.
All this is possible because of linearity, which allows us to go back and forth from real to
complex solutions by forming linear combinations, as in (1.70). These are solutions of (1.68).
Note that x (t) and x (t) are just the real and imaginary parts of z(t). The point is that you
can always reconstruct the physical real solutions to the equation of motion from the
complex solution. You can do all of the mathematics using complex variables, which
makes it much easier. Then at the end you can get the physical solution of interest just
by taking the real part of your complex solution.
Now back to the solution to (1.69). What we want to show is that we are led to irreducible,
exponential solutions for any system with time translation invariance and linearity! Thus we
will understand why we can always find irreducible solutions, not only in (1.69), but in much
more complicated situations with damping, or more degrees of freedom.
There are two crucial elements:
1. Time translation invariance, (1.33), which requires that x(t + a) is a
solution if x(t) is a solution;
2. Linearity, which allows us to form linear combinations of solutions
to get new solutions.
We will solve (1.68) using only these two elements. That will allow us to generalize our
solution immediately to any system in which the properties, (1.71), are present.
One way of using linearity is to choose a “basis” set of solutions, x (t) for j = 1 to n
which is “complete” and “linearly independent.” For the harmonic oscillator, two solutions
are all we need, so n = 2. But our analysis will be much more general and will apply, for
example, to linear systems with more degrees of freedom, so we will leave n free. What
“complete” means is that any solution, z(t), (which may be complex) can be expressed as a
linear combination of the x (t)’s,
z(t) = c x (t) . (1.72)
j j
j=1
What “linearly independent” means is that none of the x (t)’s can be expressed as a linear
combination of the others, so that the only linear combination of the x (t)s that vanishes is
the trivial combination, with only zero coefficients,
c x (t) = 0 ⇒ c = 0 . (1.73)
j j j
j=1
1.5. EXPONENTIAL SOLUTIONS 21
Now let us see whether we can find an irreducible solution that behaves simply under a
change in the initial clock setting, as in (1.38),
z(t + a) = h(a) z(t) (1.74)
for some (possibly complex) function h(a). In terms of the basis solutions, this is
z(t + a) = h(a) c x (t) . (1.75)
k k
k=1
But each of the basis solutions also goes into a solution under a time translation, and each
new solution can, in turn, be written as a linear combination of the basis solutions, as follows:
x (t + a) = R (a) x (t) . (1.76)
j jk k
k=1
Thus
Xn Xn
z(t + a) = c x (t + a) = c R (a) x (t) . (1.77)
j j j jk k
j=1 j,k=1
Comparing (1.75) and (1.77), and using (1.73), we see that we can find an irreducible solution
if and only if
c R (a) = h(a) c for all k. (1.78)
j jk k
j=1
This is called an “eigenvalue equation.” We will have much more to say about eigenvalue
equations in chapter 3, when we discuss matrix notation. For now, note that (1.78) is a set of
n homogeneous simultaneous equations in the n unknown coefficients, c . We can rewrite it
c S (a) = 0 for all k, (1.79)
j jk
j=1
where ⎧
R (a) for j 6= k,
S (a) = (1.80)
jk ⎩⎪
R (a) − h(a) for j = k.
We can find a solution to (1.78) if and only if there is a solution of the determinantal equation5
det S (a) = 0 . (1.81)
5We will discuss the determinant in detail in chapter 3, so if you have forgotten this result from algebra, don’t
worry about it for now.
22 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
(1.81) is an nth order equation in the variable h(a). It may have no real solution, but it
always has n complex solutions for h(a) (although some of the h(a) values may appear
more than once). For each solution for h(a), we can find a set of c s satisfying (1.78). The
different linear combinations, z(t), constructed in this way will be a linearly independent set
of irreducible solutions, each satisfying (1.74), for some h(a). If there are n different h(a)s,
the usual situation, they will be a complete set of irreducible solutions to the equations of
motions. Then we may as well take our solutions to be irreducible, satisfying (1.74). We will
see later what happens when some of the h(a)s appear more than once so that there are fewer
than n different ones.
Now for each such irreducible solution, we can see what the functions h(a) and z(a)
must be. If we differentiate both sides of (1.74) with respect to a, we obtain
z 0(t + a) = h0(a) z(t) . (1.82)
Setting a = 0 gives
z 0(t) = Hz(t) (1.83)
where
H ≡ h0(0) . (1.84)
This implies
z(t) ∝ eHt . (1.85)
Thus the irreducible solution is an exponential! We have shown that (1.71) leads to irreducible, exponential solutions, without using any of details of the dynamics!
1.5.1 * Building Up The Exponential
There is another way to see what (1.74) implies for the form of the irreducible solution that
does not even involve solving the simple differential equation, (1.83). Begin by setting t=0
in (1.74). This gives
h(a) = z(a)/z(0) . (1.86)
h(a) is proportional to z(a). This is particularly simple if we choose to multiply our irreducible solution by a constant so that z(0) = 1. Then (1.86) gives
h(a) = z(a) (1.87)
and therefore
z(t + a) = z(t) z(a) . (1.88)
Consider what happens for very small t = ² ¿ 1. Performing a Taylor expansion, we
can write
z(²) = 1+ H² + O(²2) (1.89)
1.5. EXPONENTIAL SOLUTIONS 23
where H = z0(0) from (1.84) and (1.87). Using (1.88), we can show that
z(N²) = [z(²)]N . (1.90)
Then for any t we can write (taking t = N²)
z(t) = lim [z(t/N)]N = lim [1 + H(t/N)]N = eHt . (1.91)
N→∞ N→∞
Thus again, we see that the irreducible solution with respect to time translation invariance is
just an exponential!6
z(t) = eHt . (1.92)
1.5.2 What is H?
When we put the irreducible solution, eHt, into (1.69), the derivatives just pull down powers
of H so the equation becomes a purely algebraic equation (dropping an overall factor of eHt)
M H2 + K = 0 . (1.93)
Now, finally, we can see the relevance of complex numbers to the above discussion of time
translation invariance. For positive M and K, the equation (1.93) has no solutions at all if we
restrict H to be real. We cannot find any real irreducible solutions. But there are always two
solutions for H in the complex numbers. In this case, the solution is
H = ±iω where ω = . (1.94)
It is only in this last step, where we actually compute H, that the details of (1.69) enter.
Until (1.93), everything followed simply from the general principles, (1.71).
Now, as above, from these two solutions, we can construct two real solutions by taking
the real and imaginary parts of z(t) = e±iωt .
x (t) = Re (z(t)) = cos ωt, x (t) = Im (z(t)) = ± sin ωt . (1.95)
Time translations mix up these two real solutions. That is why the irreducible complex exponential solutions are easier to work with. The quantity ω is the angular frequency that we
saw in (1.5) in the solution of the equation of motion for the harmonic oscillator. Any linear
6For the mathematically sophisticated, what we have done here is to use the “group” structure of time translations to find the form of the solution. In words, we have built up an arbitrarily large time translation out of little
ones.
24 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
combination of such solutions can be written in terms of an “amplitude” and a “phase” as
follows: For real c and d
c cos(ωt)+ d sin(ωt) = c (e iωt + e −iωt)/2 − id (ei ωt − e −iωt)/2
¡ ¢ ³ ´
= Re (c + id)e−iωt = Re Aeiθ e−iωt (1.96)
³ ´
= Re Ae−i(ωt−θ) = A cos(ωt − θ) .
where A is a positive real number called the amplitude,
A = c2 + d2 , (1.97)
and θ is an angle called the phase,
θ = arg(c + id) . (1.98)
These relations are another example of the equivalence of Cartesian coordinates and polar
coordinates, discussed after (1.65). The pair, c and d, are the Cartesian coordinates in the
complex plane of the complex number, c + id. The amplitude, A, and phase, θ, are the
polar coordinate representation of the same complex (1.96) shows that c and d are also the
coefficients of cos ωt and sin ωt in the real part of the product of this complex number with
e−iωt . This relation is illustrated in figure 1.9 (note the relation to figure 1.4). As z moves
clockwise with constant angular velocity, ω, around the circle, |z| = A, in the complex plane,
the real part of z undergoes simple harmonic motion, A cos(ωt − θ).
Now that you know about complex numbers and complex exponentials, you should go
back to the relation between simple harmonic motion and uniform circular motion illustrated
in figure 1.4 and in supplementary program 1-1. The uniform circular motion can interpreted
as a motion in the complex plane of the
z(t) = e−iωt . (1.99)
As t changes, z(t) moves with constant clockwise velocity around the unit circle in the complex plane. This is the clockwise motion shown in program 1-1. The real part, cos ωt, executes simple harmonic motion.
Note that we could have just as easily taken our complex solution to be e+iωt . This
would correspond to counterclockwise motion in the complex plane, but the real part, which
is all that matters physically, would be unchanged. It is conventional in physics to go to
complex solutions proportional to e−iωt . This is purely a convention. There is no physics
in it. However, it is sufficiently universal in the physics literature that we will try to do it
consistently here.

1.6 LC Circuits
One of the most important examples of an oscillating system is an LC circuit. You probably
studied these in your course on electricity and magnetism. Like a Hooke’s law spring, this
system is linear, because the relations between charge, current, voltage, and the like for ideal
inductors, capacitors and resistors are linear. Here we want to make explicit the analogy
between a particular LC circuit and a system of a mass on a spring. The LC circuit with
a resistanceless inductor with an inductance L and a capacitor of capacitance C is shown
in figure 1.10. We might not ordinarily think of this as a circuit at all, because there is no
26 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
battery or other source of electrical power. However, we could imagine, for example, that
the capacitor was charged initially when the circuit was put together. Then current would
flow when the circuit was completed. In fact, in the absence of resistance, the current would
continue to oscillate forever. We shall see that this circuit is analogous to the combination of
springs and a mass shown in figure 1.11. The oscillation frequency of the mechanical system
is s

Figure 1.11: A system analogous to figure 1.10.
We can describe the configuration of the mechanical system of figure 1.10 in terms of
x, the displacement of the block to the right. We can describe the configuration of the LC
circuit of figure 1.10 in terms of Q, the charge that has been “displaced” through the inductor
from the equilibrium situation with the capacitor uncharged. In this case, the charge displaced
through the inductor goes entirely onto the capacitor because there is nowhere else for it to
go, as shown in figure 1.12. The current through the inductor is the time derivative of the
charge that has gone through,
I = . (1.101)
To see how the LC circuit works, we can examine the voltages at various points in the
system, as shown in figure 1.13. For an inductor, the voltage drop across it is the rate of

change of current through it, or
− L = V . (1.102)
For the capacitor, the stored charge is the voltage times the capacitance, or
V = Q/C . (1.103)
Putting (1.101), (1.102) and (1.103) together gives
dI d2Q 1
L = L = − Q. (1.104)
dt dt2 C
The correspondence between the two systems is the following:
m ↔ L
K ↔ 1/C (1.105)
x ↔ Q
When we make the substitutions in (1.105), the equation of motion, (1.3), of the mass on a
spring goes into (1.104). Thus, knowing the solution, (1.6), for the mass on a spring, we can
immediately conclude that the displaced charge in this LC circuit oscillates with frequency
ω = . (1.106)
28 CHAPTER 1. HARMONIC OSCILLATION
1.7 Units — Displacement and Energy
We have now seen two very different kinds of physical systems that exhibit simple harmonic
oscillation. Others are possible as well, and we will give another example below. This is a
good time to discuss the units of the equations of motions. The “generic” equation of motion
for simple harmonic motion without damping looks like this
d2X
M = −K X (1.107)
dt2
where
X is the generalized coordinate,
M is the generalized mass, (1.108)
K is the generalized spring constant.
In the simple harmonic motion of a point mass, X is just the displacement from equilibrium,
x, M is the mass, m, and K is the spring constant, K.
The appropriate units for M and K depend on the units for X . They are conventionally
determined by the requirement that
µ ¶
1 dX 2
M (1.109)
2 dt
is the “kinetic” energy of the system arising from the change of the coordinate with time, and
KX 2 (1.110)
is the “potential” energy of the system, stored in the generalized spring.
It makes good physical sense to grant the energy a special status in these problems because in the absence of friction and external forces, the total energy, the sum of the kinetic
energy in (1.109) and the potential energy in (1.110), is constant. In the oscillation, the energy is alternately stored in kinetic energy and potential energy. When the system is in its
equilibrium configuration, but moving with its maximum velocity, the energy is all kinetic.
When the system instantaneously comes to rest at its maximum displacement, all the energy
is potential energy. In fact, it is sometimes easier to identify M and K by calculating the
kinetic and potential energies than by finding the equation of motion directly. We will use
this trick in chapter 11 to discuss water waves.
For example, in an LC circuit in SI units, we took our generalized coordinate to be a
charge, Q, in Coulombs. Energy is measured in Joules or Volts×Coulombs. The generalized
spring constant has units of
Joules Volts
Coulombs2 Coulombs
1.7. UNITS — DISPLACEMENT AND ENERGY 29
which is one over the unit of capacitance, Coulombs per Volt, or farads. The generalized
mass has units of
Joules × seconds2 Volts × seconds
Coulombs2 Amperes
which is a unit of inductance (Henrys). This is what we used in our correspondence between
the LC circuit and the mechanical oscillator, (1.105).
We can also add a generalized force to the right-hand side of (1.107). The generalized
force has units of energy over generalized displacement. This is right because when the
equation of motion is multiplied by the displacement, (1.109) and (1.110) imply that each of
the terms has units of energy. Thus for example, in the LC circuit example, the generalized
force is a voltage.
1.7.1 Constant Energy
The total energy is the sum of kinetic plus potential energy from (1.109) and (1.110),
µ ¶
1 dX 2 1
E = M + KX 2 . (1.113)
2 dt 2
If there are no external forces acting on the system, the total energy must be constant. You
can see from (1.113) that the energy can be constant for an oscillating solution only if the
angular frequency, ω, is K/M. Suppose, for example, that the generalized displacement
of the system has the form
X (t) = A sin ωt , (1.114)
where A is an amplitude with the units of X . Then the generalized velocity, is
X (t) = Aω cos ωt . (1.115)
To make the energy constant, we must have
K = ω2M . (1.116)
Then, the total energy, from (1.109) and (1.110) is
Mω2A2 cos2 ωt + KA2 sin2 ωt = KA2 . (1.117)
1.7.2 The Torsion Pendulum
One more example may be useful. Let us consider the torsion pendulum, shown in figure

Figure 1.14: Two views of a torsion pendulum.
A torsion pendulum is a simple but very useful oscillator consisting of a dumbbell or rod
supported at its center by a wire or fiber, hung from a support above. When the dumbbell is
twisted by an angle θ, as shown in the top view in figure 1.14, the wire twists and provides a
restoring torque on the dumbbell. For a suitable wire or fiber, this restoring torque is nearly
linear even for rather large displacement angles. In this system, the natural variable to use for
the displacement is the angle θ. Then the equation of motion is
d2θ
I = −αθ , (1.118)
dt2
where I is the moment of inertia of the dumbbell about its center and −αθ is the restoring
force. Thus the generalized mass is the moment of inertia, I, with units of length squared
times mass and the generalized spring constant is the constant α, with units of torque. As
expected, from (1.109) and (1.110), the kinetic energy and potential energy are (respectively)

1.8 A Simple Nonlinear Oscillator
To illustrate some of the differences between linear and nonlinear oscillators, we will give
one very simple example of a nonlinear oscillator. Consider the following nonlinear equation
1.8. A SIMPLE NONLINEAR OSCILLATOR 31
of motion: ⎧
for x > 0 ,
m x = F for x < 0 , (1.120)
dt2 ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
for x = 0 .
This describes a particle with mass, m, that is subject to a force to the left, −F , when the
particle is to the right of the origin (x(t) > 0), a force to the right, F , when the particle is to
the left of the origin (x(t) < 0), and no force when the particle is sitting right on the origin.
The potential energy for this system grows linearly on both sides of x = 0. It cannot
be differentiated at x = 0, because the derivative is not continuous there. Thus, we cannot
expand the potential energy (or the force) in a Taylor series around the point x = 0, and the
arguments of (1.21)-(1.24) do not apply.
It is easy to find a solution of (1.120). Suppose that at time, t = 0, the particle is at the
origin but moving with positive velocity, v. The particle immediately moves to the right of
the origin and decelerates with constant acceleration, −F /m, so that
x(t) = vt − 0 t2 for t ≤ τ , (1.121)
where
2mv
τ = (1.122)
is the time required for the particle to turn around and get back to the origin. At time, t = τ,
the particle moves to the left of the origin. At this point it is moving with velocity, −v,
the process is repeated for negative x and positive acceleration F /m. Then the solution
continues in the form
x(t) = −v(t − τ)+ 0 (t − τ)2 for τ ≤ t ≤ 2τ . (1.123)
Then the whole process repeats. The motion of the particle, shown in figure 1.15, looks superficially like harmonic oscillation, but the curve is a sequence of parabolas pasted together,
instead of a sine wave.
The equation of motion, (1.120), is time translation invariant. Clearly, we can start the
particle at the origin with velocity, v, at any time, t . The solution then looks like that shown
in figure 1.15 but translated in time by t . The solution has the form
x (t) = x(t − t ) (1.124)
t0 0
where x(t) is the function described by (1.121), (1.123), etc. This shown in figure 1.16 for
t = t = 3τ/4. The dotted curve corresponds to t = 0

Figure 1.16: Motion started from the origin at t = t = 3τ/4.
Like the harmonic oscillator, this system oscillates regularly and indefinitely. However, in
this case, the period of the oscillation, the time it takes to repeat, 2τ, depends on the amplitude
of the oscillation, or equivalently, on the initial velocity, v. The period is proportional to v,
from (1.122). The motion of the particle started from the origin at t = t , for an initial
velocity v/2 is shown in figure 1.17. The dotted curve corresponds to an initial velocity, v.
While the nonlinear equation of motion, (1.120), is time translation invariant, the symmetry is much less useful because the system lacks linearity. From our point of view, the
important thing about linearity (apart from the fact that it is a good approximation in so many
important physical systems), is that it allows us to choose a convenient basis for the solutions to the equation of motion. We choose them to behave simply under time translations.

Then, because of linearity, we can build up any solution as a linear combination of the basis
solutions. In a situation like (1.120), we do not have this option.
